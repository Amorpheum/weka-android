WEKA Machine Learning framework as an Android Library

This project is basically repackaging the android-ml-weka (https://github.com/Shookit/android-ml-weka) code as an Android Library (in an Android Studio project), so it makes it easy to include to other Android apps.

If you just want to add it to your Android app, download the aar file, and follow the instructions in https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library.html
